# IconButton

This component looks just like an icon but behaves like a button. It fulfils an action when you click it and has hover and focus states. You can choose which icon size you would like to use.

`IconButton` is best used when you only want an icon instead of a button with text, for example when you want to place a solitary clickable icon next to text. An example where an `IconButton` is used in Grafana is the hamburger icon at the top left which opens the new navigation.
When using `IconButton` right next to a text element consider wrapping both in a flex container and use `align-items: center;` to make them align properly.

Always keep in mind to add text for a tooltip and an aria label.

<Alert severity="warning" title={'Please note:'}>
  After reviewing this component we would like you to know that there are only 5 sizes available (sizes xs to xl). Sizes
  xxl and xxxl are now shown in size xl as well and will be deprecated in the future.
</Alert>
